WHAT WORKS:
- UI is linked to ValueTree
- Grain sound synthesis
- Delay line
- ADSR (density) 


NEEDS TO BE DONE:
- ValueTree not linked to sound generation
- SynthVoice doesn't trigger grains or clear voices correctly
- Randomisation not yet finished
- Randomisation not linked to sound generation or grain trigger
- Delay needs linking to ValueTree


WHAT HAS WORKED:
- Discord; meetings, help, updates on Github commits
- Github as a record of changes
- In person meetings 


NEEDS TO CHANGE:
- More regular meetings (never had a single meeting with everyone ever)
- Github commits are more descriptive, should stand by themselves, less often
- Once task is committed, available to complete other tasks
- Tasks should be more focussed
- Deadlines for tasks; can be revised if required
- Better organisation within branches
- Use scheduling tool for arranging meetings


TASKS:

- Merge branches and clean up 
	- Remove useless ones

- grainParameters Class; duration, envShape, frequency, noise to sine ratio, type of wave shape, amplitude, panning
	- Do it in < 12 minutes
	- Update grain to use this Class
	- Write to two channels using two different getNextValue calls
		- Facilitates panning/balance

- randomiser Class; keep ranges for each parameter
	- 10 minutes < timeToDo < 1 day
	- Clip values outside acceptable range properly to maintain randomness
		- Make range smaller (e.g. narrower cloud for extreme notes) or change centre value

- active SynthVoice should trigger densityEnv, getNextValue, decide whether to trigger grain at every sample
	- Release densityEnv when stopNote is received
	- When densityEnv is not active, stop the voice
		- Don't clear if there are still grains active, even if density is too small for new grains to be triggered

- Attach Listener to range-related parameters in the ValueTreeState
	- Example in sinSynth_withADSR
	- Parameters are in different objects and classes
		- Make sure ValueTreeState is passed to necessary classes

- Make a Doodle to organise meetings

- Listen to Mace (big boss)
