GRANULAR SYNTHESISER <br />
This synthesiser is being developed by the CAMT course. It will feature an envelope and various
effects. The envelope can be applied to various aspects of the synthesiser besides amplitude,
such as the density of the grains.

GOALS: <br />
<li>Trigger creation of grains WITHOUT RANDOMNESS with MIDI <br />
<li>Apply default ADSR values from ValueTree <br />
<li>Add sliders to edit these values and update ValueTree <br />
<li>Implement randomness &#x1f352;
